save file of number pairs.

sort number pairs into 2 sets.

for each set, order from least to greatest.

compare sets use absolute value to keep numbers positive. 
quick maths:
            n != len(p) do n+=1 abs(p1[n] - p2[n]) 
where [n] is the index to a single byte and (p) is an array of numbers
